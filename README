NAME

Debug::Show - display variables helpfully for debugging

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a facility for displaying variable values for
debugging purposes.  Statements in the code determine what values are
displayed.  Whether the statements actually cause debugging output depends
on the manner in which C<Debug::Show> was invoked, so the debug statements
can remain permanently in the code, normally inactive.  When inactive,
the debug statements impose no runtime overhead.

When the debug statements are active, each value displayed is labelled
with the expression used to generate it.  This saves the bother of
manually applying labels.
